## About IRLab

The Intelligent Robotics Lab (IRLab) at Cal Poly Pomona is dedicated to advancing research in intelligent autonomous systems. Founded and led by Dr. Daisy Tang, IRLab conducts cutting-edge research in multi-robot systems, human-robot interaction, unmanned systems (aerial, ground, and underwater), machine learning, and educational robotics.

## Research Themes

- **Multi-Robot Systems:** Algorithms and frameworks for cooperative robotic teams.
- **Human-Robot Interaction & Cooperation:** Enhancing collaboration between humans and robots in dynamic environments.
- **Unmanned Systems:** Innovations in aerial, ground, and underwater autonomous platforms.
- **Machine Learning for Robotics:** Integrating learning-based approaches for perception, planning, and control.
- **Educational Robotics:** Developing robotics curricula, tools, and outreach programs.

## Featured Projects
